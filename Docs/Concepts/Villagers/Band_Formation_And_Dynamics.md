# Band Formation and Dynamics

**Status:** In Development
**Category:** System - Aggregate Entities
**Scope:** 2+ entities with shared goals
**Created:** 2025-11-08
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-08

---

## Core Concept

**Bands are temporary or permanent groups of 2+ entities traveling together for shared goals.**

Unlike guilds (which are formal organizations with charters and bureaucracy), bands form organically when entities recognize compatible goals and decide to travel/work together.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **No formation cost** (unlike guilds' 10 gold charter fee)
- **Instant formation** after compatibility checks succeed
- **Flexible purpose** (military, civilian, mixed)
- **Dynamic leadership** based on outlook-specific criteria
- **Relation-building** through shared experiences
- **Evolution paths** (roaming village, settlement, guild backing, dissolution)

---

## Band Types by Purpose

Bands are **NOT** purely military. They form for any collective goal:

### Military Bands
- Warband (offense)
- Defense militia (village protection)
- Mercenary company (hired combat)

### Logistics Bands
- Supply caravan (resource transport)
- Construction crew (building projects)
- Repair squad (maintenance)

### Civilian Bands
- Merchant caravan (trade)
- Entertainer troupe (performance)
- Traveling artisans (crafts on the road)
- Missionary group (religious conversion)
- Adventuring party (exploration, quests)

### Work Groups
- Hunting party (food gathering)
- Mining expedition (resource extraction)
- Logging crew (timber harvesting)

---

## Formation Mechanics

### Recognition and Initiation

**System Behavior:**
When 2+ entities recognize aligned goals, the system suggests band formation.

**Formation Process:**
1. Entities with compatible goals come into contact (same location, working on same task, etc.)
2. System checks goal alignment, relations, and desires/ambitions between entities
3. If compatible, system rolls formation probability check
4. If check succeeds, band forms instantly with initiating entities as founding members

**Critical:** Formation checks **relations** (existing relationship between entities) AND **desires/ambitions** (goal compatibility).

### Formation Probability

**Base Chance:** <NEEDS SPECIFIC NUMBER>

**Modifiers:**

**Alignment Compatibility:**
- Perfect alignment match: <NEEDS MODIFIER>
- Close alignment: <NEEDS MODIFIER>
- Opposed alignment: <NEEDS MODIFIER>

**Relations Between Prospective Members:**
- Friends (+50 relation): <NEEDS MODIFIER>
- Acquaintances (+20 relation): <NEEDS MODIFIER>
- Strangers (0 relation): 0% modifier
- Dislike (-20 relation): <NEEDS MODIFIER>
- Enemies (-50 relation): <NEEDS MODIFIER>

**Individual Initiative/Boldness:**
- High initiative: <NEEDS MODIFIER>
- Low initiative: <NEEDS MODIFIER>

**Desperation Towards Goal:**
- Critical need (starving, fleeing danger): <NEEDS MODIFIER>
- Moderate need: <NEEDS MODIFIER>
- Optional goal: <NEEDS MODIFIER>

**Desires/Ambitions Compatibility:**
- Shared primary ambition (e.g., both want to "slay the dragon"): <NEEDS MODIFIER>
- Compatible ambitions (e.g., "get rich" + "become famous warrior"): <NEEDS MODIFIER>
- Unrelated ambitions: 0% modifier
- Conflicting ambitions: <NEEDS MODIFIER>

**Goal Specificity:**
- Specific shared goal (e.g., "hunt the dire wolf"): <NEEDS MODIFIER>
- General shared goal (e.g., "find food"): <NEEDS MODIFIER>

---

## Leadership Mechanics

**Leadership is NOT fixed.** The leader is determined by outlook/alignment-specific criteria.

### Leadership Election by Outlook

#### Authoritarian Bands
**Primary Criteria:** Seniority (time served as leader)
**Secondary Criteria:** Power/strength

Longer-serving leaders retain power "to an extent."

**Leadership Retention Bonus:** <NEEDS FORMULA: +X% per week served, capped at Y%?>

**Challenge Threshold:** <NEEDS FORMULA: When does a stronger member challenge?>

#### Warlike Bands
**Primary Criteria:** Power and strength
**Secondary Criteria:** Threat level, combat prowess

Members defer to the strongest/most dangerous individual.

**Power Calculation:** <NEEDS FORMULA: Raw Strength? Combat skill? Combination?>

**Leadership Threshold:** <NEEDS FORMULA: Must be X% stronger than next contender?>

#### Peaceful/Democratic Bands
**Primary Criteria:** <NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Voting? Consensus?>
**Secondary Criteria:** <NEEDS CLARIFICATION>

#### Meritocratic Bands
**Primary Criteria:** Skill relevant to band's purpose
**Secondary Criteria:** <NEEDS CLARIFICATION>

**Examples:**
- Merchant caravan: Highest trade skill leads
- Hunting party: Best tracker/hunter leads
- Construction crew: Best builder leads

#### Other Outlooks
<NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Greedy, Ambitious, etc.?>

---

## Recruitment Mechanics

### Join Request Process

When a band needs new members, the **band leader requests entities to join.**

**NOT automatic** - entities must be asked, and they evaluate the request.

### Join Probability Formula

**Base Join Chance:** <NEEDS SPECIFIC NUMBER>

**Modifiers:**

**Alignment to Band's Outlook/Alignment:**
- Perfect match: <NEEDS MODIFIER>
- Compatible: <NEEDS MODIFIER>
- Neutral: <NEEDS MODIFIER>
- Opposed: <NEEDS MODIFIER>

**Goal Alignment:**
- Entity shares band's primary goal: <NEEDS MODIFIER>
- Entity benefits from goal indirectly: <NEEDS MODIFIER>
- Entity uninterested in goal: <NEEDS MODIFIER>

**Skill Relevance:**
Each band has skill requirements for members.

- Entity has exactly needed skill: <NEEDS MODIFIER>
- Entity has related skill: <NEEDS MODIFIER>
- Entity has no relevant skill: <NEEDS MODIFIER>

**Skill Threshold Offset:**
Low skill can be offset by:
- High relations with band leader: <NEEDS FORMULA>
- Band desperation for ANY member: <NEEDS FORMULA>
- Band desperation for entity's specialty: <NEEDS FORMULA>

**Band Average Skill Impact:**
Recruiting this entity will affect the band's average skill level:
- Entity raises band average skill: <NEEDS MODIFIER> (positive, band becomes more skilled)
- Entity maintains band average skill: 0% modifier (neutral)
- Entity lowers band average skill: <NEEDS MODIFIER> (negative, band becomes less skilled)

**Note:** Meritocratic bands may reject entities who lower average skill. Desperate bands may ignore this penalty.

**Urgency:**
- Critical urgency (band needs member NOW): <NEEDS MODIFIER>
- Moderate urgency: <NEEDS MODIFIER>
- No urgency: <NEEDS MODIFIER>

**Relations with Band Leader:**
- Friend (+50 relation): <NEEDS MODIFIER>
- Acquaintance (+20 relation): <NEEDS MODIFIER>
- Neutral (0 relation): 0%
- Dislike (-20 relation): <NEEDS MODIFIER>
- Enemy (-50 relation): <NEEDS MODIFIER>

### Rejection Consequences

**Random handling** - reaction varies by individual personality and outlook.

**Mood Penalty/Boost (Leader):**
Depends on leader's outlook/personality:
- Authoritarian/Proud: High chance of anger (mood penalty, relation damage)
- Peaceful/Understanding: Low chance of anger (minor or no penalty)
- Desperate: Higher chance of frustration
- <NEEDS FORMULA: Specific percentages and mood penalties based on outlook?>

**Mood Penalty/Boost (Rejectee):**
Depends on entity's feelings about the band:
- Didn't want to join anyway: Relief (mood boost)
- Was uncertain: Minor regret or relief (random)
- Wanted to join but had conflicts: Regret (mood penalty)
- <NEEDS FORMULA: Specific mood values?>

**Relation Impact:**
- <NEEDS FORMULA: Does rejection hurt relations? How much? Outlook-dependent?>

---

## Membership Rules

### Single Band Membership

**An entity can only be in ONE band at a time.**

**Exception:** Double agents/spies can join a second band covertly.

### Multi-Guild Membership Compatibility

**An entity CAN be in both a band AND multiple guilds simultaneously.**

Example:
- A blacksmith travels with a mercenary band (band member)
- While also being a member of the Blacksmiths' Guild (guild member)
- And a member of the Dwarven Heritage Guild (guild member)

### Double Agent Mechanics

**Spy Recruitment:**
<NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How does an entity join a band as a spy? Mission from original faction? Player-directed?>

**Detection:**
Uses existing stealth/perception system (same as guild double agent detection).

**Penalties if Exposed:**
<NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Execution? Banishment? Depends on band outlook?>

---

## Relation Building

### Relation Increase from Travel

As band members travel together, their relations increase over time.

**Rate varies by outlook/alignment compatibility:**

#### Peaceful Members
- Get along with most others
- <NEEDS RATE: +X relation per day/week?>

#### Warlike Members
- Decrease relations even if aligned (abrasive personalities)
- <NEEDS RATE: -X relation per day, offset by other modifiers?>

#### Compatible Outlooks
- Entities with similar outlooks bond faster
- <NEEDS RATE: +X bonus per day/week?>

#### Opposed Outlooks
- Entities with opposed outlooks struggle
- <NEEDS RATE: -X penalty per day/week?>

### Friendship Trait Acquisition

**Trigger:** Shared hurdles and hardships

**Examples of Qualifying Events:**
- Combat survived together
- Economic hardship endured
- Long journey completed
- Quest/goal accomplished
- Life-or-death situation escaped
- Betrayal overcome together

**Friendship Levels:**
<NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Binary (Friend/Not Friend) or degrees (Companion, Close Friend, Blood Brother)?>

**Friendship Threshold:**
<NEEDS FORMULA: X shared hardships + Y relation points = Friendship trait?>

**Friendship Benefits:**
<NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Mechanical bonuses? Loyalty? Will-not-betray flag?>

---

## Band Evolution Paths

### Path 1: Roaming Village

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Families present in band (increases chance)
- Original goals completed
- Band has sustained itself for extended period
- <NEEDS THRESHOLD: Minimum size? Duration?>

**What Changes:**
- Band gains "village" mechanics (population growth, resource storage)
- Still mobile (not settled)
- May establish temporary camps with structures

**Can Revert?**
<NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Can roaming village disband back to band?>

### Path 2: Settlement (Found New Village)

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Good settlement spot found (resources, defensibility, water)
- Members had plans to settle down already
- Necessity (no food, but nearby resources make village feasible)
- Families present in band
- <NEEDS THRESHOLD: Minimum population to settle?>

**Settlement Feasibility Check:**
<NEEDS FORMULA: Food source + water + building materials + defensible terrain = viable?>

**What Happens:**
- Band dissolves as band
- Members become villagers of new village
- Band leader becomes village leader (or election held?)

### Path 3: Guild Formation (Band + Guild Coexistence)

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Band still has shared long-term goals
- Members have other pressing matters to attend to
- Goals are better served by long-distance coordination than constant travel

**What Changes:**
- Band forms a guild to represent their shared interests
- Band MAY continue roaming (guild backs the band)
- OR band members settle in villages, guild coordinates across distances

**Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Mercenary Band → Mercenary Guild**
- Band continues taking contracts (roaming)
- Guild provides contracts, reputation, resources
- Guild accepts new members who aren't in the roaming band

**Scenario 2: Adventuring Party → Heroes' Guild**
- Band completes their primary quest (slay dragon)
- Members return to separate villages
- Form Heroes' Guild to coordinate future adventures
- Guild recruits other adventurers

**Membership Rules:**
<NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Can same entity be in both the band AND the guild? Or must they choose?>

### Path 4: Dissolution

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Goal completed (and no new goal found)
- Too many casualties (morale breaks)
- Internal conflict (incompatible outlooks cause schism)
- Resource failure (band starves, goes broke)
- Leader dies (and no succession agreed upon)

**What Happens:**
- Band disbands
- Members return to civilian life (or join villages, other bands)
- Relations between members persist (friendships remain)

---

## Skill Requirements by Band Type

Each band type has different skill priorities:

### Military Bands
**Primary Skills:** Combat skills (Melee, Ranged, Magic)
**Secondary Skills:** Medical (healer), Blacksmithing (repair), Leadership

**Skill Threshold:**
<NEEDS FORMULA: Minimum combat skill to join warband? Offset by desperation?>

### Merchant Caravans
**Primary Skills:** Trade, Persuasion, Navigation
**Secondary Skills:** Combat (guard duty), Animal Handling (pack animals)

### Hunting Parties
**Primary Skills:** Tracking, Ranged combat, Animal Handling
**Secondary Skills:** Survival, Medical

### Construction Crews
**Primary Skills:** Building, Engineering, Strength
**Secondary Skills:** Leadership, Logistics

### Entertainer Troupes
**Primary Skills:** Performance, Persuasion, Artistry
**Secondary Skills:** None (entertainers are not skill-gated)

**Can Unskilled Entities Join?**
<NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Yes if relations high? Yes if band desperate? Depends on band type?>

---

## Band Desperation Mechanics

Bands can become desperate for members, which lowers skill requirements.

**Desperation Triggers:**
- Band size below minimum functional threshold
- Band lacks critical specialist (e.g., healer, blacksmith)
- Urgency (imminent combat, deadline approaching)

**Desperation Effects:**
- Increased join request probability: <NEEDS MODIFIER>
- Lowered skill threshold: <NEEDS FORMULA>
- Willingness to accept opposed outlooks: <NEEDS CLARIFICATION>

**Example:**
A military band has 3 members (below effective combat size). They desperately need a healer before the next battle. They'll accept even a low-skill healer, or even an entity with no healing skill if relations are very high.

---

## Shared Experiences and Morale

### Combat Bonuses from Shared History

Bands that fight together gain combat effectiveness.

**Friendship Bonus:**
<NEEDS FORMULA: +X% combat effectiveness per friend in band?>

**Shared Victory Bonus:**
<NEEDS FORMULA: +X morale after victory, persists Y days?>

**Vengeance Motivation:**
<NEEDS FORMULA: If band member dies, +X% damage vs killer's faction?>

### Morale Mechanics

**Band Morale vs Individual Morale:**
<NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is there aggregate band morale, or just individual morale that affects band cohesion?>

**Morale Breaks:**
<NEEDS FORMULA: At what threshold does band rout/disband?>

**Morale Restoration:**
<NEEDS FORMULA: Rest, food, victory, inspirational leader?>

## Band vs Guild Comparison

| Aspect | Band | Guild |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Formation Cost** | Free | 10 gold charter fee |
| **Formation Time** | Instant | 1 week signature gathering |
| **Purpose** | Shared immediate goal | Shared long-term interest |
| **Mobility** | Usually traveling | Usually settled in villages |
| **Leadership** | Dynamic (outlook-based) | Governance type (Democratic, Authoritarian, etc.) |
| **Membership** | Exclusive (one band only) | Non-exclusive (multiple guilds allowed) |
| **Relation Building** | Fast (shared hardships) | Slow (professional association) |
| **Evolution** | Roaming village, settlement, guild | Mergers, takeovers, dissolution |
