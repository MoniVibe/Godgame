# Elite Courts & Retinues System

**Status:** Draft - Concept Design
**Category:** System - Social & Military
**Complexity:** High
**Scope:** Elite Families (High-Ultra High wealth strata)
**Dependencies:** Individual Combat System, Stealth & Perception System, Spies & Double Agents
**Created:** 2025-11-06

## Overview

**Core Concept:** Ruling elites and wealthy families maintain **courts** composed of high-value individuals (courtiers) who serve as champions, advisors, military commanders, diplomats, and representatives. These courtiers form the backbone of elite power, providing services, securing assets, and acting on family interests (or their own corrupt agendas).

**Status:** Confirmed - Elite families employ retinues, deploy bands/armies
- Courtiers are permanent positions (unlike temporary mercenary contracts)
- Heroes can be adopted or married into families
- Families own animals (including mythical beasts) as assets and companions
- Court composition based on family wealth, alignment, outlooks, and ambitions

**Category:** Social | Military | Economic | Political

## Core Concept

### Court Structure

**Courts** are formal households maintained by elite families (High-Ultra High wealth strata). A court consists of:

1. **Ruling Family** - The head of household and immediate family members
2. **Courtiers** - Permanent employed positions (steward, diplomat, champion, etc.)
3. **Retinues** - Military bands or armies controlled by the court
4. **Representatives** - Ambassadors from other families, guilds, or villages
5. **Heroes** - Favored individuals who earned family's devotion through deeds
6. **Animal Companions** - Pets, mounts, and bonded beasts (including mythical creatures)

**Court Size Scales with Wealth:**

| Wealth Strata | Court Size | Courtier Positions | Retinue Size | Animal Companions |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Mid** | 0-2 | None (cannot afford) | None | Barn animals only |
| **High** | 3-8 | 1-2 (steward, champion) | Small band (5-10) | Horses, dogs, pets |
| **Very High** | 9-20 | 3-5 (steward, diplomat, champion, spymaster) | Medium band (20-50) | War horses, hunting beasts |
| **Ultra High** | 21-50+ | 6-10 (full court) | Army (100-500+) | Dragons, unicorns, mythical beasts |

### Retinue Loyalty & Corruption

**Loyalty Factors:**

```
RetinueLoyalty =
  SalaryCompliance +
  Warmaster/ChampionRelation +
  FamilyAlignment +
  SharedExperiences +
  RecentVictories

SalaryCompliance:
  Paid on time, full amount: +10
  Delayed payments: -5 per month
  Unpaid for 3+ months: -30 (mutiny risk)

Warmaster/Champion Relation with Family:
  +80 Devoted: +20 (troops follow leader's devotion)
  +50 Loyal: +10
  0 Neutral: 0
  -30 Hostile: -20 (commander may desert with troops)

FamilyAlignment:
  If family Good and treats troops well: +10
  If family Evil and abuses troops: -15

SharedExperiences:
  +5 per victorious battle
  -10 per crushing defeat
  +15 if family rescues wounded soldiers
  -20 if family abandons troops

RecentVictories:
  Won last 3 battles: +15 (morale high)
  Lost last 3 battles: -15 (morale broken)
```

**Mutiny Threshold:**
```
If RetinueLoyalty < -30:
  → 50% chance of mutiny per month
  → Troops desert, join rival family, or turn bandit

If RetinueLoyalty < -50:
  → 90% chance of mutiny
  → Troops actively rebel, attack family
```

**Corruption in Retinues:**

```
Corrupt Warmaster (Relation +20, Corrupt alignment):
  - Embezzles equipment budget (sells weapons on black market)
  - Accepts bribes from rivals (reveals family military plans)
  - Extorts villages in family's name (keeps profits)
  - Exaggerates troop count (phantom soldiers, pockets salaries)

  Family Response (if discovered):
    Lawful: Trial, execution if guilty
    Chaotic: Immediate dismissal, exile
    Evil: Tolerate if useful, assassinate if excessive
```

## Heroes & Favored Individuals

### How Heroes Are Earned

**Heroes** are individuals who have performed exceptional deeds for a family, earning their devotion and favor. Unlike regular courtiers (hired), heroes are **earned through action**.

**Heroic Deeds (examples):**

#### 1. **Rescue Operations**
```
Deed: Rescued family member from kidnapping/imprisonment
Relation Bonus: +40 to +60 (depending on family member's importance)

Example:
  Elira the Rogue rescued Duke Aldric's daughter from bandits
  → Aldric relation: +50 (grateful father)
  → Aldric offers: Permanent position as family champion OR marriage to daughter

  Elira (relation +50, now hero):
    "You saved my child. You are family now."
```

#### 2. **Recovered Stolen Assets**
```
Deed: Retrieved stolen family heirlooms, relics, or wealth
Relation Bonus: +20 to +40

Example:
  Marcus the Warrior recovered Barony Erik's ancestral sword (stolen by rival)
  → Erik relation: +35 (honor restored)
  → Erik offers: Land grant + title (knighthood)

  Marcus (relation +35, favored warrior):
    "The blade has returned. So has our honor. You will be rewarded."
```

#### 3. **Broken Out of Jail**
```
Deed: Broke family member out of jail/prison (illegal but loyal act)
Relation Bonus: +30 to +50

Example:
  Shade the Assassin broke Lord Verin's son out of enemy prison
  → Verin relation: +45 (debt of gratitude)
  → Verin offers: Eternal protection, safe haven, no questions asked

  Verin (Corrupt Evil):
    "You risked everything for my son. I am forever in your debt."
```

#### 4. **Champion Duels**
```
Deed: Won duels on family's behalf, defended family honor
Relation Bonus: +10 per victory (cumulative)

Example:
  Ser Aldric won 10 duels for House Maron (100 relation from victories)
  → Maron relation: +100 (Devoted, legendary champion)
  → Maron offers: Adoption into family, full inheritance rights

  Ser Aldric (relation +100):
    "You have fought for us a hundred times. You ARE a Maron now."
```

#### 5. **Saved Family from Disaster**
```
Deed: Prevented family annihilation (fire, plague, assassination plot)
Relation Bonus: +60 to +80 (existential threat averted)

Example:
  Court Wizard Merrick uncovered assassination plot, saved entire family
  → Family relation: +70 (life debt)
  → Family offers: Lifetime employment, unlimited magical research budget, vault access

  Family Head:
    "Without you, we would all be dead. Name your reward."
```

### Hero Integration Paths

**Once a hero is favored (+50+ relation), family has options:**

#### Option 1: **Adopt Hero into Family**
```
Conditions:
  - Hero relation +60+
  - Family Good or Neutral alignment (adoption as reward)
  - Hero lacks noble lineage (commoner elevated)

Process:
  - Formal adoption ceremony
  - Hero gains family name (surname change)
  - Hero inherits if no blood heirs
  - Hero gains share of family wealth
  - Hero's children become dynasty members

Narrative Impact:
  - Commoner → Noble (Cinderella story)
  - New bloodline in dynasty (fresh genetics)
  - Conflict with blood relatives (jealousy)

Example:
  Elira the Rogue (commoner) adopted by Duke Aldric
  → Elira becomes "Lady Elira Aldric"
  → Duke's blood son resents her (relation -20)
  → When Duke dies, succession conflict: Blood son vs. Adopted daughter
```

#### Option 2: **Marriage Integration**
```
Conditions:
  - Hero relation +50+
  - Hero compatible age/gender with family member
  - Family seeks alliance (strategic marriage)

Process:
  - Marry hero to son/daughter
  - Hero becomes in-law (not blood family but close)
  - Hero's children are blood dynasty members
  - Hero gains influence in family decisions

Narrative Impact:
  - Love match OR political arrangement
  - Hero's previous family (if any) gains alliance
  - May resist if relation <+30 ("arranged marriage, unwanted")

Example:
  Marcus the Warrior (hero, +55 relation) marries Barony Erik's daughter
  → Marcus becomes "Lord Consort Marcus"
  → Their children inherit barony
  → Marcus's common-born family elevated to minor nobility
```

#### Option 3: **Permanent Court Position**
```
Conditions:
  - Hero relation +40+
  - Family can afford permanent salary

Process:
  - Offer lifetime employment (Champion, Warmaster, etc.)
  - Fixed salary + benefits
  - Hero bound by oath
  - Hero NOT family, but trusted retainer

Narrative Impact:
  - Loyal servant (not equal)
  - May resent not being adopted/married (ambition)
  - Children do not inherit (servant class continues)

Example:
  Shade the Assassin (hero, +45 relation) offered Spymaster position
  → Shade accepts (lifetime employment)
  → Shade loyal but not family
  → When Shade dies, position vacant (children not auto-hired)
```

#### Option 4: **Gift & Dismissal (Honorable Discharge)**
```
Conditions:
  - Hero relation +30+
  - Family cannot afford permanent employment OR hero wants freedom

Process:
  - Gift substantial reward (land, gold, title)
  - Hero free to leave
  - Relation maintained (+30 permanent)
  - Hero may return if needed (favor system)

Narrative Impact:
  - Hero becomes independent (starts own dynasty)
  - Goodwill preserved (ally, not servant)
  - May aid family in future crises

Example:
  Warrior Kael rescued family heirloom, granted estate + knighthood
  → Kael becomes independent knight
  → Family relation +35 (gratitude)
  → When family threatened, Kael volunteers to help (remembered kindness)
```

## Animal Companions & Ownership

### Overview

Elite families own animals ranging from **barn animals** to **mythical beasts**. Some animals are merely assets (livestock), while others are cherished companions (bonded pets). **Harming a family's animal can generate grievances** equivalent to harming a family member.

### Animal Categories

#### 1. **Livestock & Barn Animals**
```
Types: Chickens, pigs, cattle, sheep
Purpose: Food production, wool, leather
Value: Low (10-100 currency each)
Emotional Attachment: Minimal
Grievance if Harmed: -5 relation (economic loss, not personal)

Example:
  Rival family raids farm, kills 20 chickens
  → Family relation: -5 (property damage)
  → Family response: Demand compensation (200 currency)
```

#### 2. **Working Animals**
```
Types: Oxen, plow horses, mules
Purpose: Agriculture, hauling, labor
Value: Medium (100-500 currency each)
Emotional Attachment: Low (tools, not pets)
Grievance if Harmed: -15 relation (expensive loss)

Example:
  Bandit kills family's oxen team
  → Family relation: -15
  → Family response: Hunt bandits, demand restitution
```

#### 3. **Caravan & Mount Animals**
```
Types: Horses, camels, donkeys
Purpose: Transportation, trade caravans
Value: Medium-High (500-2000 currency each)
Emotional Attachment: Medium (reliable companions)
Grievance if Harmed: -25 relation (valued assets)

Example:
  Merchant family's trade caravan ambushed, 5 horses killed
  → Family relation: -25
  → Family response: Hire mercenaries to eliminate bandits
```

#### 4. **Pet Companions**
```
Types: Dogs, cats, wolves, falcons, ravens
Purpose: Companionship, hunting, loyalty
Value: Medium (500-3000 currency, but priceless to owner)
Emotional Attachment: High (loved family members)
Grievance if Harmed: -40 to -60 relation (personal offense)

Special Mechanic: **Considered Family Members**
  - Family treats pet death like family member death
  - If pet killed maliciously → Blood feud
  - If pet dies naturally → Grief period (morale -10 for 6 months)

Example:
  Lord Erik's hunting dog (12 years old, relation +80) killed by rival
  → Erik relation: -60 (Hostile)
  → Erik response: "You killed my oldest friend. This means war."

  Narrative: Erik wages 5-year vendetta against rival family, eventually bankrupts them
```

#### 5. **War Animals**
```
Types: War horses, hunting beasts (bears, boars), birds of prey
Purpose: Combat, hunting, intimidation
Value: High (2000-10000 currency each)
Emotional Attachment: High (battle companions)
Grievance if Harmed: -50 relation (war buddy killed)

Example:
  Champion's war horse (fought in 20 battles together) killed in raid
  → Champion relation: -50
  → Champion response: Personal vendetta, hunts killer for months
```

#### 6. **Bonded Animals**
```
Types: Trained companions with high intelligence (wolves, eagles, exotic beasts)
Purpose: Loyal companions, combat allies, symbols of status
Value: Very High (5000-50000 currency)
Emotional Attachment: Extreme (soul-bonded)
Grievance if Harmed: -80 relation (equivalent to family member death)

Special Mechanic: **Soul Bond**
  - Animal and owner have +80 relation (Devoted)
  - Animal fights to death for owner
  - Owner avenges animal's death at any cost
  - Bond may be magical (telepathic link)

Example:
  Ranger Elira's wolf companion (raised from pup, 10 years together) killed by poachers
  → Elira relation: -80 (Mortal Enemy)
  → Elira response: Hunts every poacher in region for 3 years, executes 50+ criminals

  Narrative: "They killed my brother. I will kill them all."
```

#### 7. **Mythical Beasts**
```
Types: Dragons, unicorns, griffins, phoenixes
Purpose: Ultimate power symbols, military assets, magical allies
Value: Priceless (100,000+ currency, if buyable at all)
Emotional Attachment: Varies (depends on bond)
Grievance if Harmed: -100 relation (Mortal Enemies for life)

Special Mechanics:
  - Mythical beasts may have own agency (not "owned" but allied)
  - Harming beast may provoke beast's vengeance (dragon burns your village)
  - Family considers beast equal to dynasty heir (irreplaceable)

**Dragon Ownership:**
  - Ultra High families MAY bond with dragons (rare)
  - Dragon relation with family: Varies (-100 to +100)
  - If dragon +60 with family: Dragon defends family lands
  - If dragon harmed: Dragon + family both seek vengeance

Example:
  Ultra High Dynasty Maron bonded with dragon Skarix (300 years old)
  → Skarix relation with Maron Dynasty: +70 (ancient pact)
  → Skarix guards Maron territories, burns invaders

  Rival family assassinates Skarix (poison, 10-year plot):
    → Maron relation: -100 (Mortal Enemies)
    → Maron response: 50-year war of annihilation
    → Rival family exterminated, lands salted, name erased from history

  Narrative: "They killed our guardian. There is no forgiveness. No mercy. Only vengeance."

**Unicorn Bonding:**
  - Only Pure Good individuals can bond with unicorns
  - Unicorn relation: Must be +80+ (Devoted, pure of heart)
  - Unicorn killed → Bonded individual may die of grief (soul bond)
  - Family avenges unicorn as if family member murdered

Example:
  Lady Elira (Pure Good +90) bonded with unicorn Lumina (soul bond)
  → Lumina relation: +90 (purest love)

  Poacher kills Lumina for horn (rare magical component):
    → Elira suffers soul trauma (may die if Will check fails)
    → Family Aldric relation with poacher: -100
    → Aldric hunts poacher to ends of earth, tortures to death
    → Poacher's family annihilated (blood feud)

  Narrative: "She was light incarnate. They extinguished her. We will extinguish them."
```

```

## Edge Cases

### 1. **Corrupt Courtier Exposed**

```
Scenario: Spymaster embezzles 30% of family income for 5 years

Family discovers betrayal:
  → Spymaster relation drops to -60 (Hostile)
  → Family options:
    A) Execute spymaster (Lawful Evil)
    B) Exile spymaster (Lawful Good - mercy)
    C) Blackmail spymaster into double agent (Corrupt Good - pragmatic)
    D) Ignore if useful (Chaotic Evil - tolerate)

If executed:
  → Spymaster's family seeks vengeance (-40 relation)
  → May hire assassins to kill family head

If exiled:
  → Spymaster joins rival family, reveals secrets
  → Rival family gains intelligence advantage

If blackmailed:
  → Spymaster becomes double agent
  → 50% chance betrays again

Narrative: "Trust is currency in the game of power. Spend it wisely."
```

### 2. **Hero Refuses Adoption**

```
Scenario: Hero (+60 relation) refuses adoption offer

Reasons:
  - Hero values independence (Chaotic alignment)
  - Hero has own family/dynasty ambitions
  - Hero distrusts family motives (relation +60 but paranoid)

Family response:
  - Lawful Good: Respect decision, offer alternative (land grant)
  - Lawful Evil: Offended, relation -20 ("I offered you everything!")
  - Chaotic Neutral: Shrug, move on
  - Corrupt: Blackmail hero into compliance

Example:
  Marcus (hero, +65 relation, Chaotic Good) refuses adoption
  → Marcus: "I am honored, but I walk my own path."

  Lawful Good family: Understands, grants estate as reward (+10 relation)
  Lawful Evil family: Insulted, blacklists Marcus (-20 relation)
```

### 3. **Dragon Turns on Family**

```
Scenario: Dragon relation drops below +30 (no longer allied)

Triggers:
  - Family stops paying tribute (greed)
  - Family harms dragon's young
  - Family breaks ancient pact terms

Dragon response:
  IF relation +10 to +29: Leaves, seeks new family
  IF relation -10 to +9: Demands reparations (gold, apology)
  IF relation <-30: Attacks family, burns estates

Example:
  Dragon Skarix (relation +70) discovers family poisoned rival dragon
  → Skarix relation: -40 (betrayal, dragons are kin)
  → Skarix demands: Exile family head or face wrath

  Family refuses:
    → Skarix burns family estate
    → Skarix relation: -80 (Mortal Enemy)
    → 200-year blood feud begins

  Narrative: "You betrayed dragonkind. Now you burn."
```

### 4. **Retinue Mutiny**

```
Scenario: Retinue loyalty <-50 (troops rebel)

Triggers:
  - Unpaid for 6+ months
  - Warmaster deserts, takes troops
  - Family sends retinue on suicide mission

Mutiny Outcomes:
  A) Troops desert, become bandits
  B) Troops join rival family (if offered better terms)
  C) Troops attack family (if extreme abuse)

Example:
  Tyrant Lord sends retinue on hopeless siege, 80% casualties, no pay for 8 months
  → Retinue loyalty: -60
  → Troops mutiny, attack Lord's estate
  → Lord killed, family collapses

  Narrative: "You treated us as cattle. We treated you as prey."
```

---

## Exploits

**Problem:** Player repeatedly rescues family members to farm hero status
- **Fix:** Diminishing returns (first rescue +50, second +20, third +5)
- **Cap:** Max +80 from rescues alone (need other deeds for +100)

**Problem:** Corrupt spymasters leak all family secrets with no consequence
- **Fix:** Counterintelligence checks (paranoid families detect betrayal)
- **Penalty:** Executed spymaster's family seeks vengeance (blood feud)

**Problem:** Families spam cheap courtiers to maximize court size
- **Fix:** Court size limited by family prestige/reputation (famous families attract more courtiers)
- **Quality over quantity:** One legendary champion > ten mediocre soldiers

## Tests

- [ ] **Unit Test:** Court hiring accepts/rejects candidates based on skill thresholds
- [ ] **Unit Test:** Retinue loyalty calculation matches formula
- [ ] **Integration:** Hero adoption triggers family relation changes
- [ ] **Integration:** Dragon death triggers -100 relation with killer
- [ ] **Emergent:** Corrupt steward embezzles, family discovers, executes, steward's family retaliates
- [ ] **Emergent:** Hero refuses adoption, family respects decision, grants alternative reward
- [ ] **Stress:** 100 families each maintain 10-courtier courts = 1000 courtiers

---

## Performance

**Complexity:**
- Court hiring: O(n) where n = candidate pool size
- Retinue deployment: O(m) where m = retinue size
- Loyalty updates: O(c) where c = courtier count per family

**Max Entities:** 100 elite families × 10 courtiers = 1,000 courtiers
**Update Frequency:**
- Court salaries: Monthly
- Retinue deployments: Weekly (patrols)
- Loyalty checks: Monthly
- Hero deeds: Event-driven (real-time)

## Open Questions

### Critical

1. **Court size limits?** Should families have max courtier count or unlimited (if can afford)?
   - **PROPOSAL:** Max = Family Reputation / 10 (famous families attract more courtiers)

2. **Courtier lifespan?** Do courtiers die of old age or permanent positions?
   - **PROPOSAL:** Courtiers age and die, positions vacate (succession crisis)

3. **Hero inheritance?** If hero adopted, do their children auto-become courtiers?
   - **PROPOSAL:** Children inherit courtier position IF skilled (not automatic)

4. **Dragon ownership ethics?** Can Evil families enslave dragons or only bond?
   - **PROPOSAL:** Evil families can attempt enslavement (magical binding, risky, dragon may rebel)

### Important

5. **Courtier marriages?** Can courtiers marry each other (intra-court romance)?
   - **YES:** Courtiers can marry, relation +50 → Romance flag

6. **Retinue desertion?** Where do deserted troops go?
   - **PROPOSAL:** Become bandits (if Chaotic) or join rival family (if Lawful)

7. **Animal bonding limits?** Can one person bond with multiple animals?
   - **PROPOSAL:** Max 1 soul bond per person (exclusive, deep connection)

8. **Courtier retirement?** Can courtiers voluntarily leave (honorable discharge)?
   - **YES:** If relation +40+, can request retirement (granted land + pension)

### Nice to Have

9. **Courtier feuds?** Can courtiers have negative relations with each other (in-fighting)?
   - **YES:** Spymaster vs. Warmaster rivalry common (creates court intrigue)

10. **Animal intelligence?** Do bonded animals have own stats/agency?
    - **YES:** Bonded animals have Physique, Finesse, Will stats (mini-characters)

11. **Legendary heroes?** Can heroes achieve fame independent of family?
    - **YES:** Heroes gain personal reputation (+50 = famous, +90 = legendary)

12. **Court prestige?** Does maintaining impressive court boost family reputation?
    - **YES:** Full court (9 positions) + dragon = +30 family reputation

**For Designers:** Focus on courtier loyalty formulas and hero deed thresholds to create dramatic betrayals and redemptions. Animal grievance mechanics should feel proportional (killing livestock ≠ killing soul-bonded dragon).

**For Implementers:** Start with basic courtier hiring and small bands. Hero system and mythical beasts are v2.0/v3.0 features requiring complex relation tracking.

**For Narrative:** Courts create Game of Thrones-style intrigue (corrupt spymasters, ambitious heroes, dynastic marriages). Animal bonds enable John Wick revenge narratives ("You killed my dog" → multi-year vendetta).
