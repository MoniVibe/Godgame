# Alert State and Crisis Response System - Godgame

## Overview

Settlements don't simply react to crises when they occur—they **detect, predict, and prepare** for threats. Observatories track celestial events, scouts report enemy movements, diviners sense magical disturbances, and wise leaders stockpile resources before disaster strikes.

When crises are detected, communities enter **alert states** that modify behavior across all systems: farmers stockpile food, guards patrol more frequently, craftsmen rush defense preparations, and entire populations shift into survival mode.

Detection Capabilities:
- Weather patterns: 3-7 days advance warning
- Celestial events (eclipses, comets): 30-90 days warning
- Seasonal changes: 14-30 days warning
- Meteor strikes: 1-3 days warning

Example Detections:
- Harsh winter approaching: 14 days warning
  → Trigger: Stockpile food, gather firewood, repair buildings
- Drought predicted: 21 days warning
  → Trigger: Conserve water, plant drought-resistant crops
- Eclipse in 45 days
  → Trigger: Religious preparations, magical rituals
```

**Advanced Observatory (Crystal Scrying Tower):**
```
Cost: 50,000 gold
Staff: 1 archmage, 3 mages, 5 apprentices
Detection Range: 2000 km radius
Detection Capabilities:
- Weather patterns: 14-30 days advance warning
- Magical storms: 7-14 days warning
- Planar alignments: 60-180 days warning
- Divine omens: Variable (goddess may send visions)

Magical Enhancements:
- Scrying pools reveal distant threats
- Divination circles predict probability of events
- Astral projection scouts enemy territories
- Communication crystals relay warnings instantly
```

**Detection Examples:**

```
Early Winter Warning (14 days):
Astronomer: "Stars indicate harsh winter in two weeks."

Settlement Response:
1. Agriculture:
   - Harvest all remaining crops immediately
   - Slaughter excess livestock (preserve meat)
   - Store grains in protected granaries
   - Stockpile firewood (double normal amount)

2. Economy:
   - Grain prices increase 20% (anticipation)
   - Merchants rush to buy supplies
   - Peasants hoard food (reduce market availability)

3. Construction:
   - Repair roofs before snow
   - Seal cracks in walls
   - Build emergency shelters

4. Population Behavior:
   - Elderly/sick moved to warm indoor spaces
   - Families stockpile blankets, warm clothing
   - Hunters increase activity (preserve meat for winter)

Result: Settlement survives winter with 10% fewer deaths vs no warning
```

```
Meteor Strike Warning (2 days):
Astronomer: "Flaming star approaches! Impact in 48 hours, 50 km north!"

Settlement Response:
1. Immediate Evacuation (if in impact zone):
   - Mayor orders evacuation
   - Population flees south
   - Valuables loaded on carts
   - Livestock driven away

2. Preparation (if outside impact zone):
   - Reinforce buildings (brace for shockwave)
   - Move valuables underground
   - Stockpile water (dust cloud may contaminate wells)
   - Mages prepare protective wards

3. Post-Impact (if survived):
   - Send scouts to impact crater
   - Harvest meteor iron (rare material)
   - Check for magical contamination
   - Rebuild damaged structures

Result: 80% survival rate with warning vs 30% without
```

## Crisis-Specific Responses

### 1. Resource Shortage Crisis

**Detection:**
```
Triggers:
- Granary levels drop below 30 days supply
- Failed harvest (drought, blight, locusts)
- Trade routes blocked (war, bandits)
- Population growth exceeds food production

Warning Signs (14-30 days before crisis):

- Expand foraging territory (+50% range)

Result: Shortage avoided if harvest succeeds or trade restored
```

**Level 2 (Alarmed): Critical Shortage (30 → 15 days)**
```
Population Response:
- 30% reduce meals to 2/day instead of 3
- Poor begin starving (children, elderly first)
- Crime increases (theft of food +50%)

```
Population Response:
- Mass starvation begins (10-30% death rate)

- Gold worthless (can't eat it)
- Barter only (any food = extreme value)

Military:
- Soldiers fed from remaining stocks
- Militia deserts to feed families
- Risk of coup (starving population vs hoarding nobles)

Result: 20-50% population death, refugees flee, settlement may collapse
```

**Level 4 (Desperate): Collapse (< 5 days, death imminent)**
```
Population Response:
- Mass exodus (50%+ flee to find food elsewhere)
- Remaining population too weak to move
- Cannibalism confirmed (desperate survival)
- Some surrender to enemies for food

Administrative Response:

**Prevention Through Early Detection:**
```
Observatory Prediction (30 days warning):
"Drought will kill harvest. Winter will be harsh."

Immediate Response:
- Buy grain from neighboring regions NOW (before prices rise)
- Ration food immediately (extend 30-day supply to 90 days)
- Send hunters/foragers to stockpile preserved food
- Negotiate emergency loans from wealthy or lord
- Plant fast-growing crops (turnips, radishes - mature in 30-45 days)

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Connection to Infiltration Detection System

```
Alert States Align:

Infiltration Detection Levels → Crisis Alert States
- Level 0 (Normal) → Alert State 0 (Normal)
- Level 1 (Suspicious) → Alert State 1 (Concerned)
- Level 2 (Incident) → Alert State 2 (Alarmed)
- Level 3 (Crisis) → Alert State 3 (Crisis)

Behavioral Changes:
- Guards patrol more frequently (infiltration) = Guards mobilize (invasion)
- Civilians lock doors (infiltration) = Civilians flee/hide (invasion)
- Checkpoints established (infiltration) = Gates sealed (invasion)
- Investigation begins (infiltration) = Defenses erected (invasion)

Cross-System Effects:
- Infiltration during siege = Higher alert (compound crises)
- Resource shortage + invasion = Desperate situation (cannot sustain defense)
- Plague + infiltration = Total chaos (multiple simultaneous crises)
```

### ECS Integration

**Body ECS (60 Hz):**
```csharp
public struct WorkRateComponent : IComponentData
{
    public float BaseWorkRate; // 1.0 = normal
    public float AlertModifier; // Crisis multiplies work rate
}

// Resource shortage crisis
if (crisisType == CrisisType.ResourceShortage)
{
    workRate.AlertModifier = 2.0f; // Work twice as hard
}
```

**Mind ECS (1 Hz):**
```csharp
public struct AlertAwarenessComponent : IComponentData
{
    public int CurrentAlertLevel; // 0-4
    public CrisisType KnownCrisis; // What crisis they're aware of
    public float FearLevel; // 0-100, affects decision-making
    public float PreparationTime; // Days to prepare before crisis hits
}

// Modify behavior based on alert
public static void AdjustBehaviorForAlert(
    ref BehaviorComponent behavior,
    in AlertAwarenessComponent alert)
{
    switch (alert.CurrentAlertLevel)
    {
        case 1: // Concerned
            behavior.CautiousModifier += 0.2f; // 20% more cautious
            break;
        case 2: // Alarmed
            behavior.CautiousModifier += 0.5f;
            behavior.AggessionModifier -= 0.3f; // Less aggressive, more defensive
            break;
        case 3: // Crisis
            behavior.SurvivalMode = true; // Override normal goals
            break;
        case 4: // Desperate
            behavior.PanicMode = true; // Irrational decisions
            break;
    }
}
```

**Aggregate ECS (0.2 Hz):**
```csharp
public struct SettlementAlertComponent : IComponentData
{
    public int GlobalAlertLevel; // Settlement-wide alert
    public CrisisType ActiveCrisis;
    public float TimeUntilCrisis; // Days remaining to prepare
    public float CrisisDuration; // How long crisis has been active
    public bool EvacuationOrdered;
    public bool MartialLawActive;
}

public static void PropagateAlertToPopulation(
    ref SettlementAlertComponent settlement,
    float deltaTime)
{
    // Alert spreads through population over time
    // All entities in settlement become aware of crisis within 1-6 hours
}
```

## Summary

The Alert State and Crisis Response System creates **proactive gameplay** where:

**Detection Systems:**
1. **Observatories**: Predict weather, celestial events (3-90 days warning)
2. **Scouts**: Report threats, army movements (hours to days warning)
3. **Spies**: Political intelligence, invasion plans (weeks warning)
4. **Divination**: Magical foresight, divine visions (days to years warning)

**Crisis Types:**
- **Resource Shortage**: Gatherers work 2× harder, rationing, starvation
- **Infiltration**: Curfews, checkpoints, heightened guard awareness
- **Invasion**: Muster guards, train militia, erect defenses, stockpile for siege
- **Natural Disaster**: Evacuate, reinforce buildings, stockpile supplies
- **Plague**: Quarantine, burn infected, flee to safety
- **Political**: Martial law, purges, coup attempts

**Alert States (0-4):**
- Normal → Concerned → Alarmed → Crisis → Desperate
- Each level modifies behavior across all systems
- Population works harder, guards patrol more, economy shifts

**Preparation Benefits:**
- 30-day warning for invasion: 70% survival vs 30% surprise
- 14-day warning for famine: Minimal deaths vs 30% starvation
- 2-day warning for meteor: 80% survival vs 30% no warning

**Integration:**
- Connects to Infiltration Detection (alert levels align)
- Body ECS: Work rate modifiers during crisis
- Mind ECS: Fear, preparation, behavior changes
- Aggregate ECS: Settlement-wide crisis propagation

This system creates **emergent strategic depth** where wise leaders who invest in observatories, scouts, and divination can save their people through early warning and preparation.
