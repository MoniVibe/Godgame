# Mech/Construct System - Godgame

## Overview

In Godgame, mechs manifest as magical constructs, animated war machines, golems, and mechanized armor suits. These constructs follow similar principles to ships, with chassis (frames) that hold modules (enchantments, weapons, armor) which may have addons (enhancements, amplifiers). Constructs vary in size, quality, rarity, and magical tech level, and are piloted through various methods ranging from single-mage mental links to coordinated ritual control to swarm command.

**Piloting Configurations:**
- **Single Pilot**: One mage mentally controls one construct
- **Multi-Pilot**: 2-5 mages coordinate to power a large construct
- **Swarm Master**: One arch-mage controls 5-50 smaller constructs simultaneously

---

## Piloting Configurations

### Single Pilot Control

**Mental Link Requirements:**
- Pilot INT: 50+ for Small constructs, 70+ for Medium, 90+ for Large
- Concentration DC: 15 base + (construct size × 5)
- Link stability: 95% at optimal INT, -5% per 10 points below requirement

**Pilot Fatigue:**
- Small construct: 1 fatigue/hour
- Medium construct: 3 fatigue/hour
- Large construct: 8 fatigue/hour
- Exhaustion at 100 fatigue (8 hours medium construct operation)

**Pilot Skill Bonuses:**
- **Golem Mastery** (passive): +10% to all construct stats per skill level
- **Efficient Link** (passive): -20% fatigue accumulation
- **Overclock** (active): +30% construct speed for 15 sec, 2 min cooldown
- **Emergency Eject** (active): Instantly exit construct, 5 min cooldown

---

### Multi-Pilot Coordination

**Crew Composition (Siege Titan, 5 pilots):**
1. **Commander** (INT 85+): Overall strategy, target selection
2. **Power Channeler** (WIS 80+): Manage mana distribution
3. **Weapons Officer** (DEX 75+): Aim and fire weapons
4. **Defense Coordinator** (INT 75+): Activate shields, manage armor
5. **Engineer** (INT 70+): Emergency repairs, module optimization

**Coordination Bonus:**
- Base efficiency: 70% (untrained crew)
- Trained crew: 90% efficiency
- Veteran crew: 110% efficiency (synergy bonus)
- Elite crew: 130% efficiency (+30% all stats)

**Coordination Check:**
```
Crew Coordination = (Average Pilot INT / 100) × Training Multiplier × Communication Quality

Training Multiplier:
- Untrained: 0.7
- Trained: 0.9
- Veteran: 1.1
- Elite: 1.3

Communication Quality:
- Clear (all conscious): 1.0
- Degraded (1 pilot incapacitated): 0.7
- Critical (2+ pilots down): 0.4
```

**Example:**
Elite crew (avg INT 80) with clear communication:
- Coordination = (80/100) × 1.3 × 1.0 = **1.04 (104% efficiency)**
- Siege Titan with 20,000 base HP effectively has **20,800 HP**
- Weapons deal **+4% damage**

---

### Swarm Master Control

**Hive Mind Network:**
- Arch-mage (INT 95+) controls multiple constructs simultaneously
- **Control limit**: `(INT - 70) / 5` constructs (INT 95 = 5 constructs, INT 120 = 10 constructs)
- Each construct operates at reduced efficiency based on swarm size

**Efficiency Degradation:**
```
Construct Efficiency = 100% - (Active Construct Count × 8%)

Examples:
- 1 construct: 92% efficiency
- 5 constructs: 60% efficiency
- 10 constructs: 20% efficiency
- 15 constructs: 0% efficiency (overload, all constructs disabled)
```

**Swarm Tactics:**
- **Coordinated Strike**: All constructs attack same target simultaneously (+20% damage)
- **Defensive Formation**: Constructs shield each other (each +15% armor, stacking)
- **Flanking Maneuver**: Surround target (ignore 40% armor)
- **Distraction Protocol**: 50% of constructs feint while rest attack (+30% crit chance)

**Hive Mind Perks:**
- **Shared Vision**: See through all construct sensors simultaneously
- **Instant Redeployment**: Swap focus between constructs instantly (no action cost)
- **Distributed Processing**: If one construct destroyed, others gain +5% efficiency
- **Neural Overload** (active): Sacrifice one construct to boost others by +40% for 20 sec

**Swarm Master Example:**
Arch-mage (INT 100) controls 6 Crystal Automatons:
- Control limit: (100 - 70) / 5 = **6 constructs** (at maximum capacity)
- Efficiency per construct: 100% - (6 × 8%) = **52% efficiency**
- Each automaton: 500 base HP × 0.52 = **260 effective HP**
- Coordinated strike damage: (80 base × 0.52) × 1.2 = **50 damage per automaton**
- Total burst damage (6 automatons): 50 × 6 = **300 damage in one strike**

---

---

## Module Compatibility

Not all modules fit in all chassis. Compatibility is determined by:

1. **Slot Count**: Chassis must have available slots
2. **Power Requirements**: Core must supply sufficient mana
3. **Size Class**: Modules have minimum chassis size requirements
4. **Weight Capacity**: Total module weight ≤ chassis capacity

**Example Incompatibility:**
- Heavy Weapon Mount (size 3) requires Large or Colossus chassis
- Crystal Automaton (Small chassis, 4 slots) cannot equip Heavy Weapon Mount
- Siege Titan can equip up to 4× Heavy Weapon Mounts (16 slots total, each mount = 3 slots, 12 slots consumed)

**Power Budget:**
```
Available Power = Core Capacity - (Idle Consumption + Active Module Consumption)

Idle Consumption:
- Small construct: 50 mana/sec
- Medium construct: 100 mana/sec
- Large construct: 250 mana/sec
- Colossus construct: 600 mana/sec

Active Module Consumption (when firing/active):
- Light weapon: 30-60 mana/sec
- Medium weapon: 80-150 mana/sec
- Heavy weapon: 200-400 mana/sec
- Shield generator: 40-80 mana/sec
- Sensor array: 20-40 mana/sec
```

**Example Power Budget:**
Siege Titan with Legendary Elemental Heart (4,000 mana, 120 mana/sec regen):
- Idle: 600 mana/sec (deficit: -480 mana/sec, drains in 8.3 sec if standing still)
- Combat: 600 + 400 (2× heavy weapons) + 60 (shield) = 1,060 mana/sec
- Net deficit: 1,060 - 120 = **-940 mana/sec**
- **Combat duration: 4,000 / 940 = 4.25 seconds of continuous fire**
- **Tactical firing (burst, then recharge) extends operational time**

---

## Construct Lifecycle

**Construction Time:**
- Small construct: 2-4 weeks (1 artificer)
- Medium construct: 2-3 months (2-3 artificers)
- Large construct: 6-12 months (5-8 artificers)
- Colossus construct: 1-3 years (12-20 artificers + master enchanter)

**Construction Cost:**
- Small: 5,000-15,000 gold
- Medium: 30,000-80,000 gold
- Large: 200,000-500,000 gold
- Colossus: 1,500,000-4,000,000 gold

**Quality Impact on Construction:**

**Crew Coordination:**
- Training: Elite (1.3× multiplier)
- Avg INT: 82
- Coordination: (82/100) × 1.3 × 1.0 = **1.066 (106.6% efficiency)**

**Effective Stats:**
- HP: 35,000 × 1.066 = **37,310 HP**
- Armor: (110 + 320) × 1.066 = **458 armor** (damage reduction: 82%)
- Lightning Cannon: 1,200 × 1.066 = **1,279 damage**
- Flame Projector: 800 × 1.066 = **853 damage** (15m cone)

**Assault Scenario:**
Mountain's Wrath approaches enemy fortress walls (8,000 HP, 200 armor):
- Sensory array detects 40 archers on walls (400m range)
- Ward shield activates (5,000 HP barrier)
- Archers fire volley: 40 arrows × 80 damage = 3,200 damage absorbed by barrier (1,800 HP remaining)
- Lightning Cannon fires: 1,279 damage - 200 armor = **1,079 damage to wall**
- Chain lightning hits 5 archers: 640 damage each (4 killed instantly)
- Flame Projector sweeps wall section: 853 damage to 12 archers (15m cone, all killed)
- Ballista mounts fire: 600 × 2 = 1,200 damage to wall - 200 armor = **1,000 damage**
- Total wall damage after 1 volley: 1,079 + 1,000 = **2,079 damage** (wall: 5,921 HP remaining)

### Scenario 3: Crystal Automaton Swarm

**Swarm Master**: Arch-mage Sylara (INT 105, Hive Mind Mastery)

**Swarm**: 8 Crystal Automatons

**Individual Automaton Stats:**
- HP: 700
- Armor: 20
- Speed: 12 m/s
- Weapon: Crystal blade (100 damage)
- Module: Hive link (swarm coordination)

**Swarm Control:**
- Control limit: (105 - 70) / 5 = **7 constructs** (operating at 8, overextended)
- Efficiency: 100% - (8 × 8%) = **36% efficiency** (overextended penalty)
- Effective HP per automaton: 700 × 0.36 = **252 HP**
- Effective damage: 100 × 0.36 = **36 damage per automaton**

**Swarm Tactics:**
- **Coordinated Strike** active: +20% damage = **43 damage per automaton**
- Total burst damage (8 automatons): 43 × 8 = **344 damage in one synchronized strike**

**Combat Scenario:**
Swarm engages armored knight (2,000 HP, 80 armor):
- Flanking Maneuver: Automatons surround knight (ignore 40% armor = 48 armor ignored)
- Effective armor: 80 - 48 = **32 armor**
- Damage per automaton: 43 - 32 = **11 damage**
- Total damage per round: 11 × 8 = **88 damage**
- Knight counterattacks: Cleave attack hits 3 automatons (300 damage each)
- 3 automatons destroyed (252 HP < 300 damage)
- Remaining automatons: 5
- Efficiency recalculates: 100% - (5 × 8%) = **60% efficiency** (now within control limit)
- New effective damage: 100 × 0.6 × 1.2 (coordinated) = **72 damage per automaton**
- New total damage: 72 × 5 - 32 armor = **40 damage × 5 = 200 damage**
- Rounds to kill knight: 2,000 / 200 = **10 rounds** (~10 seconds)

**Swarm Master Advantage:**
- Shared Vision: Sylara sees knight's blind spots through 5 different angles
- Instant Redeployment: Switches focus to avoid knight's next cleave
- Distributed Processing: Destroyed automatons grant +5% efficiency each (+15% total)
- Final efficiency: 60% + 15% = **75% efficiency**
- Adjusted damage: 100 × 0.75 × 1.2 = **90 damage per automaton**
- Adjusted total: (90 - 32) × 5 = **290 damage per round**
- **Actual rounds to kill: 7 rounds (~7 seconds)**
