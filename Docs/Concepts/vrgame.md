Here’s a 1-page style pitch you can drop to your buddy:

Working Title: Last Light

Elevator Pitch
Last Light is a co-op VR “last stand simulator” where you and your friends are the final line of defense for a fragile beacon of light in a world consumed by darkness. It plays like a mix of Space Pirate Trainer (intense VR combat) + XCOM/Darkest Dungeon (squad management, sacrifices, and permadeath): you fight on the front lines in VR while making brutal, real-time decisions about who lives, who dies, and what you’re willing to burn to keep the darkness at bay.

Core Fantasy

You are the will of a reverse Eye of Sauron: a blinding beacon on a hill that holds back an ocean of demons and monsters.

You command and fight alongside desperate defenders: terrified conscripts, hardened guards, pyromancers, etc.

Every battle is a “this might be it” last stand, where saving the village might mean sacrificing half of it.

Gameplay Overview
Macro: The World of Darkness

You have a central settlement around the beacon: shelters, smithy, storehouse, etc.

You expand outward with small outposts to gather resources and craft gear.

The darkness pushes back: monsters raid expansions, burn buildings, and kill your people permanently.

Between attacks you:

Assign villagers to jobs (farmer, smith, guard, etc.).

Craft and upgrade weapons, armor, and spells.

Decide which fronts to reinforce and which you’re willing to lose.

Micro: VR Combat Missions

When a location is attacked, you drop into VR as one of the defenders.

Combat feels like Space Pirate Trainer vs demons:

Physical aiming, blocking, parrying, spellcasting.

Clear enemy waves, projectiles, and big telegraphed attacks.

Instead of free locomotion, you choose destinations and pace:

Pick where your character tries to move (gate, rooftop, chokepoint).

Choose a stance on a spectrum:

Cautious: slower, defensive, higher survival.

Reckless: fast, high damage, high risk of glorious death.

While fighting, you issue simple squad orders in real time:

“Defend the smithy,” “Fall back to the beacon,” “Cover the evacuation.”

Signature Mechanic: “Declare Last Stand”

At any battle, you can declare a Last Stand:

Visually/physically: slam your weapon into the beacon, ring a massive bell, or trigger a relic.

For a short time:

Defenders in that area get huge buffs: damage, morale, maybe slow-mo.

But their chance of dying permanently skyrockets.

Aftermath:

Survivors are legends (big XP, traits), but many will fall.

The beacon is drained → global penalty next missions (long cooldown, weaker buffs, etc.).

It’s the “nuke button” you can press often—but you really, really don’t want to.

Progression & Tone

Villagers remember: fallen defenders leave behind stories, traits, maybe relics that shape the settlement.

You feel the difference between:

A terrified farmer with a pitchfork, and

A veteran guardsman in plate, swinging a Zweihander or hurling fireballs.

The long-term goal: push the darkness back, map by map, until the world is slowly reclaimed… or your beacon finally goes out.

Multiplayer

Co-op: 2–4 players defending the same beacon, sharing:

The pool of defenders, gear, and villagers.

The consequences of Last Stand calls (you’ll argue about this a lot).

Future idea: PvPvE – rival beacons racing to hold out longer, steal resources, or sabotage each other through the darkness.

Why This Could Be Awesome

VR usually does moment-to-moment action; Last Light adds emotional weight and long-term stakes.

It combines visceral VR combat with XCOM/Darkest Dungeon-style sacrifice and strategy.

Every session creates stories like: “Remember when we sacrificed the smith and his whole squad so the kids could evacuate?”
