# Progress Hub

Single place to track current goals, lanes, and session notes. Append new entries instead of overwriting history.

## Where to start
- Workflow: `AGENTS.md`
- Active lanes: `prompts.md`
- Main TODOs: `Docs/TODO/Godgame_PureDOTS_Integration_TODO.md`, `Docs/TODO/Phase2_Demo_TODO.md`
- Truth Sources: `Docs/TruthSources_QuickReference.md`

## How to start/resume (Agents A/B/C)
- Find your lane in **Active lanes** (A: Phase 2 closure, B: alignment/compliance, C: modules/degradation).
- Before working: add a dated “Started” note to the **Rolling session log** with your lane and focus.
- While working: update the relevant TODO (`Godgame_PureDOTS_Integration_TODO.md` or `Phase2_Demo_TODO.md`) instead of creating new lists.
- When finishing/pausing: append a dated “Ended” note with progress, tests run, and next unblock.

## Milestones & owners
- Phase 2 demo closure (time/rewind determinism + mining/haul continuity) — owner: _(assign)_ — ETA: _(set)_.
- Phase 3 Agent A (alignment/compliance system) — owner: _(assign)_ — ETA: _(set)_.
- Phase 3 Agent B (modules/refit/degradation) — owner: _(assign)_ — ETA: _(set)_.

## Active lanes (mirror prompts.md)

- Alt B: modules/degradation — module slot/refit system, degradation/repair flows, crew skills influencing refit/repair/combat.

## Rolling session log (append new entries at top)
- 2025-11-29 — Ended Camera Input Bring-Up: added `GodgameCameraInputBehaviour` (pan XZ + scroll zoom with per-frame logging), `CameraInputRig` prefab under `Resources/Prefabs` (HandCamera bindings baked in), and runtime bootstrap that spawns the rig if scenes forget it. Tests not run (runtime-only change).
- 2025-11-28 — Ended Agent A (demo bootstrap/input cleanup): added default DemoOptions fallback + Input System hotkeys/time controls, HUD metrics wiring, presentation binding bootstrap (Minimal) with bindings moved under Resources, auto camera helper + FX sanity ping, and GODGAME_DEMO define. Tests not run (editor-only changes).
- 2025-11-28 — Started Agent A (demo bootstrap/input cleanup): ensuring demo scene bootstraps with default scenario, input module and HUD bindings working under new Input System; will wire camera/default scenario fallback and HUD metrics.
- 2025-01-XX — Ended Demo Documentation Overhaul: archived 8 legacy demo docs to `Docs/Archive/Demo_Legacy/`, created new demo documentation suite in `Docs/Demo/` (9 spec files covering build, bootstrap, slices, bindings, instrumentation, preflight, packaging, scenarios, talk track), updated `Docs/INDEX.md` and `Docs/Progress.md`. All documentation now aligned with new demo build specification. No code changes, documentation only.
- 2025-01-XX — Started Demo Documentation Overhaul: archiving existing demo docs and creating new spec-driven documentation suite based on demo build requirements.
- 2025-11-28 — Ended Agent C (registry/system group restoration): surfaced SpatialSystemGroup/GameplaySystemGroup/TransportPhaseGroup stubs, added VillagerLessonRegistryEntry + telemetry metric helpers, and wrote dependency/telemetry tests. Unity tests not run (code-only change).
- 2025-11-28 — Started Agent C (registry/system group restoration): recreating missing PureDOTS system groups and lesson registry entry so registry bridge systems compile; adding telemetry metric helpers and coverage. Tests planned.
- 2025-11-28 — Ended Agent D (miracles domain rebuild): restored DOTS miracles data structs + bootstrap (caster state, slot definitions, rain commands, release events), added miracle system smoke tests, and attempted Unity edit-mode run (Unity binary missing). Follow-ups: add miracle fields to DivineHandInput and rerun tests once Unity CLI is available.
- 2025-11-28 — Started Agent D (miracles domain rebuild): reintroducing MiracleCasterState/MiracleSlotDefinition/RainMiracleCommand/MiracleReleaseEvent structs, wiring GodgameMiracleInputSystem & GodgameMiracleReleaseSystem, and validating source-generated miracles compile + edit-mode tests. Tests not run yet.
- 2025-11-28 — Started Agent B (biome/ground/weather namespace alignment): refining BiomeTerrain/GroundTile/WeatherController/FaunaAmbientSpawn/MiraclePresentation systems to shared namespaces and ensuring GroundBiome structs are blittable. Tests not run yet.
- 2025-11-28 — Ended Agent C (assembly/namespace restoration): added PureDOTS.Environment asmdef/stubs plus Systems/Input placeholders (Hand/Climate groups, DivineHand, Villager AI), wired Godgame.Runtime/System asmdefs, and stubbed PlaybackGuardTag. Unity CLI missing on host so SystemGenerator recompile not run; BiomeType now exposed for Agent D. Tests not run.
- 2025-11-28 — Ended Agent D (Biome Types & Data): recreated `PureDOTS.Environment` stubs (BiomeType/climate grids/EnvironmentSystemGroup) and `EnvironmentGridConfig` authoring to unbreak BiomeTerrain assets; BiomeTerrainProfile assets now align with restored enum order and GodgameEnvironmentGridConfig points to a live script. Domain reload still pending once Agent C finishes namespace restoration. Tests not run.
- 2025-11-28 — Started Agent D (Biome Types & Data): locating/recreating BiomeType definition, wiring into BiomeTerrainAgent/BiomeTerrainProfile, validating authoring assets/profiles load and align with TruthSources inventory; will rerun domain reload after namespace restoration. Tests not run yet.
- 2025-11-28 — Started Agent C (assembly/namespace restoration): investigating missing PureDOTS.Environment/System/Input assemblies and asmdef references; goal is to restore namespace resolution and confirm SystemGenerator output compiles. Tests pending.
- 2025-11-27 — Disabled visual asset imports for clean Godgame initialization: (1) Removed `DISTANT_LANDS;COZY_WEATHER` scripting defines from ProjectSettings, (2) Renamed `Assets/ThirdParty` → `Assets/ThirdParty.disabled` to prevent Unity import (21,939 files from ToonyTinyRTS, COZY Weather, POLYGON packs, etc.), (3) Cleared broken visual prefab references from Villager/Housing/Storehouse/VillageCenter/WorshipSite prefabs, (4) Updated Villager material to use Unity default. Ground biome materials remain (in `Assets/Ground/Biome/`). Project now initializes with Unity primitives as placeholders until visuals pass.
- 2025-11-27 — Fixed Godgame CS0308: `StaticVisualAuthoring.cs` Baker class shadowed Unity.Entities.Baker, added full qualification. Updated PureDOTS BC1016 request with **corrected fix pattern**: the previous `static readonly FixedString*` fix creates static constructors (.cctor) which Burst also can't compile (BC1091). Correct fix: initialize FixedStrings in `OnCreate` as instance fields or use SharedStatic.
- 2025-11-27 — Created PureDOTS request documents: (1) `PureDOTS_Burst_BC1016_Fix_Request.md` (CRITICAL) for 4 files with managed string ops blocking 60+ systems, (2) `PureDOTS_FocusSystem_Request.md` for game-agnostic combat resource migration. Updated `GodgameDOTSRequest.md` index with request document links. These should land in PureDOTS request folder per template.
- 2025-11-27 — Diagnosed Unity Editor freezes: (1) disabled orphaned `Space4X.Editor.asmdef` causing assembly resolution failures from sibling project with compilation errors, (2) rate-limited `EntityMeetingSystem` O(n²) algorithm to prevent play-mode hangs with large entity counts, (3) captured new Burst BC1016 error batch (4 files in PureDOTS: `AggregateHelpers.cs:227`, `HazardEmitFromDamageSystem.cs:128`, `LifeBoatEjectorSystem.cs:85`, `SchoolFoundingSystem.cs:148` using managed string ops in Burst) and documented fix pattern in TODO. Tests not run.
- 2025-11-27 — Ended Agent 1 (BC1016 fixes for aggregates/spells): cached FixedString constants for BandFormationSystem goal descriptions plus BandFormationProcessingSystem goal/name comparisons; SpellEffectExecutionSystem shield default already cached. Tests not run; rerun PureDOTS domain reload with Burst enabled to verify BC1016 cleared.
- 2025-11-27 — Ended Agent 6 (CreateAssetMenu warning cleanup, part 2): removed CreateAssetMenu attributes from PureDOTS authoring MonoBehaviours (BuffCatalog/SchoolComplexityCatalog/QualityFormula/SpellSignatureCatalog/QualityCurve) to clear ignored-attribute console warnings; Unity domain reload/tests not run this pass.
- 2025-11-27 — Ended Agent 5 (CreateAssetMenu warnings cleanup, part 1): removed CreateAssetMenu attributes from PureDOTS CultureStoryCatalogAuthoring/LessonCatalogAuthoring/SpellCatalogAuthoring/ItemPartCatalogAuthoring/EnlightenmentProfileAuthoring; tests not run (Editor/domain reload not executed this pass).

- 2025-11-27 — Ended Agent 7 Integration Verification: static inspection only; Godgame targets look clean (presentation editor, dev scene tools updated), PureDOTS still has BC1016 literals and CreateAssetMenu-on-MonoBehaviour warnings outstanding; Unity domain reload/tests not run this pass.
- 2025-11-27 — Ended Agent 3 (presentation editor fixes): added `Godgame.Presentation` runtime asmdef + meta and pointed `Godgame.Presentation.Editor` to it so SwappablePresentationBindingEditor sees PresentationRegistry/SwappablePresentationBindingAuthoring; tests not run (asmdef/editor-only change).
- 2025-11-27 — Ended Agent 1 (Phase 2 demo closure): added PlayMode coverage for time spine rewind gating and logistics registry continuity (`TimeRewindDeterminismPlayModeTests`), aligned AIBehaviorSystemsTests with the current TimeState struct, and noted coverage in the integration TODO. Tests not run (Unity PlayMode suite not executed this pass).
- 2025-11-27 — Started Agent 3 (presentation editor fixes): investigating CS0234/CS0246 on SwappablePresentationBindingEditor and validating Presentation registry types.

- 2025-11-26 — Focus Growth Mechanics: Added XP/wisdom growth from focus usage. Entities who push themselves grow faster than those who relax. New components: `FocusMotivation` enum (Casual/Leisurely/Survival/Ambitious/Passionate/Dutiful/Desperate/Perfectionist), `FocusGrowthTracking` (lifetime focus, daily usage, intensity averages, high/low effort days), `FocusGrowthConfig` (XP per focus, wisdom per 1000 focus, daily modifiers). New systems: `FocusGrowthSystem` (tracks usage), `FocusMotivationSystem` (determines motivation from circumstances). New helpers: `FocusGrowthHelpers`, `FocusXPIntegration`. Design: Most entities use 20-40% focus casually; only survival/ambition/passion drives 60-100% usage. Updated PureDOTS extension request with growth mechanics.
- 2025-11-26 — Expanded Focus System (profession abilities): Extended Focus from combat-only to universal excellence resource. Added 40+ new profession abilities across 5 categories: **Crafting** (MassProduction/MasterworkFocus/BatchCrafting/PrecisionWork/etc), **Gathering** (SpeedGather/EfficientGather/GatherOverdrive/ResourceSense/etc), **Healing** (MassHeal/LifeClutch/IntensiveCare/RegenerationAura/etc), **Teaching** (IntensiveLessons/DeepTeaching/GroupInstruction/Eureka/etc), **Refining** (RapidRefine/PureExtraction/BatchRefine/Transmutation/etc).
