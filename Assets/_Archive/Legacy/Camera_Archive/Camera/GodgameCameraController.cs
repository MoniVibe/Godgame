// MOVED: This file has been moved to Assets/Scripts/Godgame/Camera/GodgameCameraController.cs
// All functionality has been consolidated into the canonical location.
// Reflection hacks have been removed - now uses direct calls to CameraRigService and BW2StyleCameraController.
// Do not use this file - use Godgame.GodgameCameraController from Assets/Scripts/Godgame/Camera/ instead.
